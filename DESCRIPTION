Description: An R interface to 'Cheetah Grid', a high-performance JavaScript table widget. 
    'cheetahR' allows users to render millions of rows in just a few milliseconds, 
    making it an excellent alternative to other R table widgets. The package wraps 
    the 'Cheetah Grid' JavaScript functions and makes them readily available for R users.
    The underlying grid implementation is based on 'Cheetah Grid'
